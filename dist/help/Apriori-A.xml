		<type>Association Rules Mining by means of Classical Algorithms</type>

		<objective>Apriori is the first successful algorithm used for mining quantitative association rules.
We have  provided a fast implementation of this algorithm by employing prefix trees for counting the support of frequent itemsets.</objective>

		<howWork>The main aim of Apriori is to explore the search space by means of the downward closure property.
The latter states that any subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.
As a consequence, it generates candidates for the current iteration by means of frequent itemsets collected from the previous iteration.
Then, it enumerates all the subsets for each transaction and increments the support of candidates which match them.
Finally, those having a user-specified minimum support are marked as frequent for the next iteration.
This process is repeated until all frequent itemsets have been found.
Therefore, Apriori follows a breadth-first strategy to generate candidates.
The algorithm usually ends when the maximum size of frequent itemsets is reached.
This size is always fixed to the total number of attributes of the given database.
However, the process may terminate earlier if there are no new discovered frequent itemsets at the end of an iteration.</howWork>
