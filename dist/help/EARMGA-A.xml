		<type>Association Rules Mining by means of Genetic Algorithms</type>

		<objective>EARMGA (Evolutionary Association Rules Mining with Genetic Algorithm) mines quantitative association rules of a fixed lenght in which numerical attributes are represented by a finite union of uniform intervals.</objective>

		<howWork>The genetic algorithm first initializes the current population with new chromosomes obtained by subsequent applications of the mutation operator over a given seed chromosome.
At each iteration, the selection operator filters the chromosomes of the current population, producing the new one.
Then, any pair of chromosomes in this new population is crossed over to reproduce two offsprings.
In the next step, some of these chromosomes might also be changed due to the mutation operator and will be included into the new population.
Finally, the overall process iterates until a given maximum number of loops is reached, thus generating a final population of a given size of high-quality association rules.</howWork>
