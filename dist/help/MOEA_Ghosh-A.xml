		<type>Association Rules Mining by means of Genetic Algorithms</type>

		<objective>The proposed algorithm uses a Pareto based GA to extract some useful and interesting rules from any dataset.</objective>

		<howWork>The genetic learning is performed iteratively until a maximum number of evaluations is reached. 
First, the algorithm generates an initial population at random.
Then, it computes the objective functions for each rule, ranks them depending on the non-dominance property and assigns a fitness value using its rank.
Later, a separate population is updated, which will contain all non-dominated solutions found.
The chromosomes are selected by roulette wheel selection scheme using the fitness and these chromosomes replace all chromosomes of the old population.
The multi-point crossover and mutation are performed on the new individuals.
Finally, the overall process iterates until a given maximum number of evaluations is reached. 
At the end, the separate population is returned.
