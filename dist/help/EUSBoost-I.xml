		<howWork>EUS-Boost is based on RUSBoost, one of the simplest and most accurate ensemble, which combines random undersampling with Boosting algorithm. This 
			methodology aims to improve the existing proposals enhancing the performance of the base classifiers by the usage of the evolutionary undersampling approach. 
			Besides, it promotes diversity favoring the usage of different subsets of majority class instances to train each base classifier.

		<parameterSpec>  
			<param>pruned: specificies if the decision tree must be pruned or not</param>
			<param>confidence: is the confidence level. It is a float value that determines what is the minimal confidence that must has a leaf in order to can be considered in the tree</param>
			<param>instancesPerLeaf: minimum number of instances to consider a leaf for the decision tree</param>
			<param>Number of Classifiers: is the number of iterations that the boosting procedure will use (the total number of classifiers is the number of classifiers times the number or bags)</param>
