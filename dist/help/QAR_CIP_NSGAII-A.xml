		<type>Association Rules Mining by means of Genetic Algorithms</type>

		<objective>The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm mines a reduced set of positive and negative quatitative association rules that are interesting, easy to understand and with a good trade-off between the number of rules, support and coverage of the dataset.</objective>

		<howWork>The genetic learning is performed iteratively until a maximum number of evaluations is reached. 
First, the algorithm generates an initial population and initializes the external population (EP) with nondominated rules from the initial population.
Then an offspring population is generated from the current population by selection, crossover and mutation. 
The next population is constructed from the current and offspring populations, the EP is updated with the current population and, if necessary, the restarting process is applied. 
At the end, the EP is returned.
The NSGA-II algorithm has two features, which make it a high-performance MOEA. One is the fitness evaluation of each solution based on the Pareto ranking 
and a crowding measure, and the other is an elitist generation update procedure.
