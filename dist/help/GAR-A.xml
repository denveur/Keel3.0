		<type>Association Rules Mining by means of Genetic Algorithms</type>

		<objective>GAR (Genetic Association Rules) discovers frequent itemsets of a variable size by spanning as much as possible the domain intervals of all the numerical attributes without the necessity of an a priori discretization.</objective>

		<howWork>GAR evaluates the fitness of the chromosomes by rewarding frequent itemsets that have a high support as well as a high number of attributes.
Moreover, it punishes frequent itemsets which have already covered a record in the database and whose intervals are too large.
By following the Iterative Rule Learning (IRL) approach, it iterates until a desired number of frequent itemsets are obtained at the end of a main loop.
First, an initial population is generated by randomly creating chromosomes.
Then, during an internal loop, it calculates the fitness of each individual and carries out the processes of selection, crossover and mutation to complete the next population until a given number of generations is reached.
At the end of this loop, the individual with the best fitness is chosen and it will correspond with one of the frequent itemsets that the algorithm returns.
Moreover, records covered by the best individual are penalized in order to provoke diversity before starting over the internal loop.</howWork>
