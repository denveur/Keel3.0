		<type>Association Rules Mining by means of Genetic Algorithms</type>

		<objective>GENAR (GENetic Association Rules) searches quantitative association rules of a fixed length in the way that only the last attribute of the database acts as the consequent, whereas all the previous ones represent the antecedent part.</objective>

		<howWork>GENAR employs a fitness function which considers the support count for the rules by punishing those having already covered the same records in the database.
By following the Iterative Rule Learning (IRL) approach, its genetic scheme consists in executing a main loop as many times as rules we want to obtain.
An initial population is generated paying attention to not overcome the maximum amplitude of the intervals of each attribute.
Within an internal loop, the algorithm evaluates the fitness for all the individuals of the current population and builds the next one by carrying out the usual operations of selection, crossover and mutation.
This loop will be executed until a given number of generations is reached.
At the end, the best individual is chosen from the population formed in the last generation and added to the set of the final association rules.</howWork>
