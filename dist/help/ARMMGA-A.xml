		<type>Association Rules Mining by means of Genetic Algorithms</type>

		<objective>The genetic algorithm mines association rules without considering minimum support, conﬁdence and interestingness, and extract the best rules with high values of these measures</objective>

		<howWork>First the initialization population is produced by initialization function and is spotted as the best population.
Then if the termination function returns true, the best population is returned as output function, otherwise the selection function is performed on population and the parent's population is selected by it.
Then the crossover function is performed on the parents’ population and an offspring population is produced. 
In next step, the mutation function is performed on some offspring chromosomes and ﬁnally, the ﬁnal population is selected from parent and offspring populations. 
If the average of ﬁtness of ﬁnal population is larger than the best population of previous stages or if they are equal and the variance of it is larger than or equal to the variance of ﬁtness of the best population of previous stages, 
the best population is replaced with the current ﬁnal population. 
The genetic learning is performed iteratively until a maximum number of evaluations is reached.
At the end, the best population is returned.
