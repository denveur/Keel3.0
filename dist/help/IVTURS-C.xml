		IVTURS is composed of three stages: 1) The generation of an initial Interval-Valued Fuzzy
Rule-Based Classification System (IV-FRBCS). To do this, the rule base is firstly learn using
the recent fuzzy rule learning algorithm known as FARC-HD (Fuzzy Association Rule-based
Classification model for High Dimensional problems) and then, the linguistic labels are modeled with IVFSs; 
2) The application of an IV-FRM and 3) An optimization step using the synergy between the tuning of the equivalence and rule
selection.
