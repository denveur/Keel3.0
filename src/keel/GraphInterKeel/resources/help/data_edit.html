      <ul>
        <li><strong><em>Modify the cell content</em></strong>: if you want to modify the cell content you have to click on       the cell that you want to change. Then, you only have to write the new       value, and if it is valid, the cell content is modified. Otherwise an       error dialog is shown. </li>
        <li><strong><em>Delete an instance</em></strong>: if you want to delete an instance, you have to click       on any cell which corresponds with the instance (row) that you want to       delete. Then, a &ldquo;Delete       Instace&rdquo; button is activated. When you click on it, the full instance will       be deleted.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Add a new instance: </em></strong>if you want to add  a new instance, you have to click the &ldquo;Add Instance&rdquo; button.  Then, a new instance is added, if a cell was selected, the new instance is added at  top of the instance where you had the cell selected. If no cell was selected,  a new instance is added at the bottom of the table. The new instance has empty values  and the different variables can be filled out clicking on the different cells.</li>
