  <p><b>KEEL Tool 2.0 Description</b></p>

</div>
<p>KEEL is a software tool developed to build and use different 

    Data Mining models. The main features of KEEL are:</p>

<ul>

  <li> It contains pre-processing algorithms: transformation, discretization, 

    instance selections and feature selections. </li>

  <li> It also contains a Knowledge Extraction Algorithms Library, supervised 

    and unsupervised, remarking the incorporation of multiple evolutionary learning 

    algorithms. </li>

  <li> It has a statistical analysis library to analyze algorithms. </li>

  <li> It contains an user-friendly interface, oriented to the analysis of algorithms. 

  </li>

</ul>

<p>We can distinguish three parts in the graphic environment:</p>
 
<ul>
<li><b>Data Management:</b> the Data Management part allows users to create new Datasets or to create some partitions from an existing one. Also, you can view information from Datasets of your own, with the only restriction that they must meet the Keel format. In addition, it is possible to edit and apply transformations to the existing Datasets.<br>
Another important thing is that the Data Management part allows you to generate Datasets in the keel format from UCI files.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Experiments:</b> the Experiments part has the objective of designing the desired experiments 

  using a graphical interface. Doubtless, this is the more innovative tool integrated 

  in this tool. The objective is to use available datasets and algorithms to generate 

  a directory structure with all the necessary files needed to run the designed 

  experiments in the local computer selected by the user. Now, you can forget 

  scripts and other parameter files that made arduous the design of an experiment, 

  and begin to use the new windows based interface. <br>

With this program, yon only need to select the input data (datasets), the algorithms 

  you want to use and to make the opportune connections between them. Also it 

  is possible to concatenate methods, insert statistical tests, etc ...<br>

One of the tasks that was more simplified is probably the configuration of the 

  parameters; everything can be done from a simple dialog without requirement 

  of external configuration files.<br>

This part of KEEL has two main objectives: on the one hand, you can use 

  the software as a test and evaluation tool during the development of an algorithm. 

  On the other hand, it is also a good option in order to compare new developments 

  with standard algorithms already implemented and available in KEEL 1.0. <br><br></li>

<li><b>Teaching:</b> the teaching part has the main objective of designing the desired experiments 

  using a graphical interface and an on-line execution of those experiments, being posible to stop and resume them as you need. Also, you can see the results of those experiments into the environment.<br>
However, this part has a reduced number of available methods and lacks of result method and statistical test<br><br></li>
